# Chapter Twenty-Three: The Arrest

* Open with Dot unlocking the café. Maybe a couple of baristas are there waiting on her?
* From earlier notes “In later chapter: Harold gets evidence to authorities RE: the empty residential property that was raided. Maybe it’s Tom that handles the dirty work?”
  * Maybe they pin the bombing on Archie?
* Police come to visit again.
* Archie is feeling less bold, less invincible.
* Archie puts his rebel phone into Dot’s purse when he suspects that he’ll be taken away.
* “Dot, will you mind the shop while I’m gone?”
