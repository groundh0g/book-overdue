# Acknowledgements

I would like to thank my wife, Tina, for her encouragement. When I only had a raw idea, she enthusiastically nudged me to follow through with the project. Similarly, my two software developer homies Steven Lowe and Andrew Rollings used their considerable influence over me to not let the novel fall by the wayside.

My middle rugrat, Abigail, deserves a shout out as well for inspiring me with her own love of writing. Our shared passion translates to shared motivation to finish what we've started. I'm also grateful that I outrank her in the family pecking order, so coercing her into reviewing and editing my work was a breeze.

It is said that to be a great writer, you must be an avid reader. I consider myself neither, but there are a couple of authors who inspired me to pursue this creative path. Many thanks to Daniel Suarez for *Daemon* and Dean Koontz for *Odd Thomas*. Those were the models of great books that spurred me on.
