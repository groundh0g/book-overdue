# Chapter Sixteen: The Story


* Focus on subplot with Kara Moran’s ambitions
* New intelligence from Cecelia, how she might make it a national story?
* I’ll need a new, local story for later chapter where Darnell and Valerie are having coffee together. Used to move conversation from small talk to politics and rebellion.
