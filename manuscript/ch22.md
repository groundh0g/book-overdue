# Chapter Twenty-Two: The Bombing

* Substation is bombed.
* Not sure who really did it ... Cecelia, Lukman, or Aldrich? Certainly not rebels.
* Given recent attention MIGCO focuses on Archie (partly at Tom’s suggestion)
* Darnell thinks it’s a bad idea.
  * Realizes that Archie is rebel (Duh), but ...
  * he just got his foot into the door. 
  * Could lead to bigger fish.
  * Besides, we don’t have any concrete evidence linking Archie to bomb.
* Aldrich decides to proceed. Have Archie picked up.
  * Why? Did Tom sway decision? Does Aldrich know who planted the bomb and is looking to Archie as patsy?
