# Chapter Twenty: The Introduction


* Valerie introduces Darnell into her cell – Archie’s cell! 
* WTH? Archie is a rebel? (Yep.)
* Archie has seen Darnell in café but doesn’t know anything about him. Darnell interjects before Archie can give much thought “Hey, you’re the manager of the Mad Canopy, aren’t you?” “The owner, actually.”
* [More stuff here.]
