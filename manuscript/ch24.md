# Chapter Twenty-Four: The Deal

* Eddie visits Archie in jail as his lawyer
* Explains what can happen if Archie tries to leave cell
* Too much at stake. Too many brave soldiers that could fall with him. Reestablishes Archie’s faith in movement. It’s not perfect, but consider the alternative. Need to convince the people to be self-reliant, end dependency on government, and reclaim their freedoms.
* Ultimately Archie concedes
* In later chapter:
  * Eddie gets Archie released
  * Archie has to keep low profile from now on
