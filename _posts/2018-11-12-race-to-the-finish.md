Well, the inevitable happened today. Abby surpassed my word count.

She's a machine. Her dedication to meeting each day's writing goals is unwavering. Unlike my own, where motivation ebbs and flows.

I guess I could blame my malaise and lethargy on the recent passing of Stan Lee. That's an easy out, right? Anything but my own natural laziness and tendency towards distraction. Surely it can't be **my** fault.

Oh, well. I should probably stop lamenting my stalled efforts and start churning out more cheesy prose.
