It's official. Eleven days into [NaNoWriMo](https://nanowrimo.org/) and I'm finally back on track with my novel, [*Overdue Diligence*](https://groundh0g.github.io/book-overdue/).

Where did that time go? I'm glad you asked ...

I just launched [leanpub-jekyll](https://github.com/groundh0g/leanpub-jekyll) &mdash; a wrapper for [Leanpub](https://leanpub.com/)'s `manuscript` folder that provides a [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/)-based blog and several pages to promote your book-in-progress and report on its status.

You can write and blog in the same format &mdash; [Markdown](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet). Plain-text editing is a joy. And the content you produce for Leanpub can easily be used with a print service like [Lulu](https://www.lulu.com/).

Enough pimping, I've got to get back to my novel!
