[Leanpub-jekyll](https://github.com/groundh0g/leanpub-jekyll) has been sucking most of my writing time lately, but I'm trying to get back on track with [NaNoWriMo](https://nanowrimo.org/) and my novel, [*Overdue Diligence*](https://groundh0g.github.io/book-overdue/).

I bought used copies of the books that inspired me to write my own novel for inspiration. They are [*Daemon*](https://amzn.to/2DLnSDR){:target="_blank"} by Daniel Suarez and [*Odd Thomas*](https://amzn.to/2DLg0lF){:target="_blank"} by Dean Koontz. It's my hope that reviewing the works I love so much will help me overcome my bad habits (e.g. "show don't tell").

On the positive (negative?) side, Abby's schoolwork has slowed her progress as well, so there's a slim chance that I can catch up to her word count.
